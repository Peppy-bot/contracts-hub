# Contracts Hub

A repository of Peppy **contracts** (`peppy_schema: "contract/v1"`).

A contract declares the topics, services, and actions a node must expose to implement it. A producer claims a contract in `manifest.implements` and lists every contract member as an explicit contract-backed entry in its `interfaces` section, using the implementation's `link_id`. A consumer depends on the contract through `manifest.depends_on.contracts` rather than on a specific node, so any implementing producer can satisfy it.

## Adding a contract

Create a new `.json5` file under the relevant category:

```json5
{
  peppy_schema: "contract/v1",
  manifest: { name: "<contract_name>", tag: "<tag>" }, // tag is a contract identifier like "v1" — not semver (dots forbidden)
  interfaces: {
    topics:   [ /* ... */ ],
    services: [ /* ... */ ],
    actions:  [ /* ... */ ],
  }
}
```

## Use

This repo is consumed by `peppy repo update` alongside node and launcher repositories.
